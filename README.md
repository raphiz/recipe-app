# Recipe App

A small showcase application on how one could use the [Hotwire Stack](https://hotwired.dev/) together with Kotlin, [kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html) and Spring. No NPM required - just Java 17+.

## Starting the application

Just clone this repo and start the application as you would any Spring Boot Application:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Next, visit the site on http://localhost:8080/
